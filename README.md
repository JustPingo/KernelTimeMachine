# LATEST BUILD CONTAINS BRICKING BUGS 100% OF THE TIME
# DO NOT DOWNGRADE WITH IT FOR ANY REASON

Kernel Time Machine is a work in progress tool to downgrade firmware on the 3DS safely using TPP files.

Visit [this GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/clarification-thread-what-is-going-on.407074/) to learn more on what this project is all about.

## This is still a WIP.
Please note that there might be some typos and mistakes due to the fact that I'm not using an IDE and did not try to compile it yet. It shouldn't work yet. Please note that the main file is pretty big for now, and will probably get splitted up later on.

## DISCLAIMER:
**Run this program at your own risk. I do not recommend running it, even if your 3DS is hardmodded.**

## Building

The program requires [devkitARM](http://devkitpro.org/) and zlib.

Run the `make` command on the KernelTimeMachine main folder. (If you are on Windows, you can use the msys program incluided in [DevKitPro](http://devkitpro.org/), [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) and on Mac you can use Xcode or [install make manually](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2556444/install-make-command-without-already-having-make-mac-os-10-5))

## Installing
After building, place the files created by make in the 3ds folder on your SD card and launch it through the [homebrew launcher](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/).
